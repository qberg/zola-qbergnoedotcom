We live in a world where computers are woven into the very fabric of our lives. They power our homes, fuel our workplaces, and shape the rhythm of our social lives. From the smartphones nestled in our pockets to the sprawling servers that keep the internet alive, computers hum quietly behind the scenes, an invisible force powering modern existence.

But here’s the truth: computers don’t think for themselves. They don't dream, create or decide. They’re tools—remarkable ones, yes—but tools nonetheless. Every action they take is guided by human hands, every instruction written by someone, somewhere. And that brings us to the heart of the matter: _who writes software and who controls it?_

This is where the battle for digital freedom begins. Software isn’t just lines of code; it’s a form of power. Like any form of power, it can liberate or control, uplift or oppress. Richard Stallman, the visionary behind the free software movement, understood this better than most. To him, software wasn’t merely a technical construct—it was a matter of human rights. And he was right. Profoundly, unshakeably right.

## What is Free Software?

The term free software is often misunderstood. It doesnot mean software that costs nothing, it means software that respects the users' freedom. It's about ensuring that users, not corporations, hold the reins of the software they depend on. At its heart lies a simple yet profound philosophy: _software should serve humanity, not enslave it._

Richard Stallman outlines four freedoms that forms the foundations of free software[^1],

### Freedom 0: The Freedom to Run the Program as You Wish

Picture buying a car, only to have the manufacturer locking the hood, preventing you from ever checking or repairing the engine. Worse they've installed a tracking device that monitors your every move and dictates which roads you can drive on. Absurd, right? Yet proprietary software imposes similar restrictions all the time. Free software ensures that you can use your tools however you see fit, free from artificial constraints.

### Freedom 1: The Freedom to Study and Modify the Source Code

Knowledge is power, and access to knowledge is a fundamental right. Proprietary software keeps its source code hidden, like a magician guarding a trick. But in a just world, people should be able to open the hood, study how things work, and modify them if needed. If software shapes our lives, then we must have the ability to shape software.

### Freedom 2: The Freedom to Redistribute Copies

Imagine if lending a book to a friend was illegal. Or if sharing food with a hungry person was a crime. Proprietary software enforces this kind of digital selfishness, prohibiting users from sharing useful tools. Free software, on the other hand, encourages community, knowledge exchange, and progress.

### Freedom 3: The Freedom to Improve the Program and Distribute Your Improvements

Society thrives on progress. Imagine if only one company could repair broken roads or invent new medical treatments. That would stifle innovation. Free software ensures that anyone can contribute, improve, and distribute better versions of a program, benefiting everyone.

## The Reality of Proprietary Software

These freedoms aren’t abstract ideals—they’re practical safeguards against tyranny in the digital age. Without them, we cede control to those who wield software as a weapon of profit and domination. Proprietary software are programs that users cannot freely run, study, modify, or share. They are black boxes that demand trust without transparency. The corporations that develop them hold absolute control, dictating what you can and cannot do with your own devices.

Think of proprietary software as digital handcuffs. When you use Microsoft Windows, macOS, or Adobe products, you are not in control—the company is. They decide when to update, when to remove features, and even when to stop supporting the software entirely. Worse, they have the power to spy on you, restrict your choices, and manipulate how you interact with your own computer.

With proprietary software you don't buy software; you buy a license to use it under their terms. You are never truly the owner.

## What Can You Do?

- **Use Free Software** – Replace proprietary software with open-source alternatives. Linux instead of Windows. LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office. Firefox instead of Chrome.
- **Contribute** - If you can code, contribute to free software projects. If not, donate to organizations like the Free Software Foundation[^2].
- **Spread the Word** - Talk to your friends, family, and colleagues about the importance of free software. Help them understand why this matters.

## Why This Matters: The Bigger Picture

Some might argue, "I don't care about free software. I just want something that works." But consider this analogy: Would you shrug off democracy because it’s easier to let someone else make decisions for you? Convenience at the cost of freedom is a dangerous bargain.

When you choose proprietary software, you’re not just giving up control—you’re enabling a system that prioritizes profit over people. You’re supporting companies that lock down knowledge, exploit users, and build monopolies. You’re contributing to a world where technology becomes a tool of oppression rather than empowerment.

Free software flips the script. It’s a rebellion against corporate greed and technological authoritarianism. It declares that technology should serve humanity , not the other way around. It champions transparency, fairness, and inclusivity in a world increasingly dominated by opaque algorithms and centralized control.

Choose wisely.
